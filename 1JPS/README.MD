### Generating the Interaction Data

We used molecular dynamics simulation data from the crystal structure of tissue factor (TF) conjugated to humanized Fab D3h4 (Fab), identified with PDB ID 1JPS.This assembly's dynamic 100 ns trajectory is derived from Jandova et al. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00336](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00336). Using the CHARMM36m force field and the GROMACS simulation program version 2019, the authors ran simulations on 1JPS. We took samples of this trajectory at 500 ps intervals, which gave us 200 time-dependent coordinates for 1JPS (complex_md-fit.pdb).

Three chains were present in the 1JPS structure: tissue factor (TF), two antibody chains (heavy and light). We combined the heavy and light chains of the MD ensemble (100 ns, 200 frames) into a single chain in order to examine Fab as a monomeric entity. We added 1000 to the original numbers of the heavy chain residues of Fab in order to prevent overlapping residue numbers. Then, We used the [interfacea](https://github.com/JoaoRodrigues/interfacea/tree/master) Python module to calculate the non-covalent interaction characteristics for each snapshot. This library computes the hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and inter-chain hydrophobic interactions given a complicated PDB coordinate as input. For Quick generating the interaction data, you must run `interaction_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
